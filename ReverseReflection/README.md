# Token Contract

This is a Solidity smart contract for a token that implements the ERC20 interface and includes reverse reflection and taxable features without minting.

## Overview

The token contract is designed to allow for token transfers with a reflection fee that is added to a reserve balance, and a reverse reflection mechanism that penalizes long-term holders with a negative interest rate. The contract is also taxable, meaning that it deducts a fee on each transaction and sends it to the reserve balance.

The contract includes an ownable functionality that allows the owner to withdraw the reserve balance. It does not have mint functionality, meaning that the total supply of tokens is fixed and cannot be increased.

## Features

- Implements the ERC20 interface.
- Allows for token transfers with a reflection fee that is added to a reserve balance.
- Has a reverse reflection mechanism that penalizes long-term holders with a negative interest rate.
- Is taxable, meaning that it deducts a fee on each transaction and sends it to the reserve balance.
- Implements an ownable functionality to allow the owner to withdraw the reserve balance.
- Does not have mint functionality.

## Parameters

The contract includes several adjustable parameters that can be fine-tuned to customize its behavior:

- `REFLECTION_RATE_DECIMALS`: The number of decimal places used for the reflection fee rate.
- `MIN_HOLDING_TIME`: The minimum amount of time that a token holder needs to hold their tokens in order to avoid a penalty fee.
- `MAX_PENALTY_RATE`: The maximum penalty rate expressed as a percentage.
- `REBASE_INTERVAL`: The amount of time between each rebase operation.

## Usage

To use the token contract, you can deploy it to the Ethereum network using a tool like Remix or Truffle. Once deployed, you can interact with the contract using a wallet like MetaMask or MyEtherWallet.

To transfer tokens, simply call the `transfer` function and specify the recipient's address and the amount of tokens to transfer. The reflection fee and penalty fee (if applicable) will be calculated automatically by the contract.

To withdraw the reserve balance, call the `withdrawReserve` function as the contract owner.
